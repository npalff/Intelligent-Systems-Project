This project was developed in Python 3 using TensorFlow Keras as a project exercise part of the Intelligent Systems: Recognition and Reasoning subject at Grenoble INP - ENSIMAG - Information Systems Engineering.

The main goal of this project was to utilize the MNIST dataset and neural networks to develop models capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits. To accomplish this, two types of networks were chosen: a fully connected multi-layer network and a multi-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
